    <p>
      The website <a href="https://DigiByte.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://DigiByte.org</a> (hereinafter referred to as the "Website") provides general information and materials for informational purposes only.

While the community is decentralized and self-regulating, please be aware that risks always exist. If any participant is found to be acting with questionable intent, the community is committed to addressing such behavior through transparency and collective oversight.
